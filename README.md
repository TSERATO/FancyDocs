# FancyDocs

Official documentation for all plugins and web services developed by FancyInnovations.

# Getting Started

To start the docs locally, clone the repository and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001`.

The markdown files are located in the `content/docs/` directory. You can edit these files to update the documentation.

Some files are generated from templates located in the `templates/` directory. 
Changes made directly to these files (in the `content/docs/` directory) will be overridden when the templates are regenerated.
Please make changes to the template files instead.
