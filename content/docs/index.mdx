## About FancyInnovations

FancyInnovations is a collection of plugins for Minecraft servers. The plugins are designed to be easy to use and highly customizable. The plugins are open-source and free to use.

We focus on plugins that can serve many different use-cases. Everyone should be able to use our plugins, no matter if you're running a small private server or a large public server. For large and more complex use-cases, we offer an API that allows you to extend the plugins with your own features.
