title: Custom Models
---

This is a highly requested feature that allows server owners to use custom 3D models for NPCs instead of the default Minecraft models.
This feature enhances the visual appeal and uniqueness of NPCs in your server.

Discussion and progress on this feature can be found in our Discord server in the [#suggestions channel](https://discord.com/channels/1092507996166295644/1298775843644117033).
