title: Open Dialog with NPC
description: How to open a dialog using FancyNPCs' NPCs
---

<Callout type="warn">
    This action is only available if both [FancyDialogs](https://modrinth.com/plugin/fancydialogs) AND [FancyNpcs](https://modrinth.com/plugin/fancynpcs) are installed on the server.
</Callout>

When you have both FancyDialogs and FancyNpcs installed, FancyDialogs automatically registers a new action type called `open_dialog` in the FancyNpcs action system. This allows you to create interactive NPCs that open custom dialogs when players interact with them.

## Adding the Action

To add the dialog action to an NPC, use the following command:

```
/npc action <npc_id> ANY_CLICK add open_dialog <dialog_id>
```

### Parameters

- `<npc_id>`: The ID or name of the NPC you want to add the action to
- `<dialog_id>`: The ID of the dialog you want to open (must exist in `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs/`)

### Click Types

You can customize when the dialog opens by changing the click type:

- `ANY_CLICK`: Opens the dialog on any click (left or right)
- `LEFT_CLICK`: Opens the dialog only on left click
- `RIGHT_CLICK`: Opens the dialog only on right click

## Example

Here's a complete example of creating an NPC that opens a welcome dialog:

```
# Create the NPC
/npc create shop_keeper

# Add the dialog action
/npc action shop_keeper ANY_CLICK add open_dialog welcome

# Move the NPC to your location
/npc movehere shop_keeper
```

Now when players click on the NPC, they'll see the welcome dialog.

<Callout>
    You can add multiple actions to an NPC. For example, you could open a dialog AND execute a command when the player clicks the NPC.
