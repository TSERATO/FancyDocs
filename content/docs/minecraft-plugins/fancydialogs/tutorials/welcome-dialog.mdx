The welcome dialog feature allows you to greet new players when they join your server for the first time. This is a great way to introduce players to your server, share important information, and make a positive first impression.

![Welcome Dialog Example](/fancydialogs/examples/oliver-welcome.png)

## Default Welcome Dialog

FancyDialogs comes with a pre-configured welcome dialog that you can use immediately or customize to match your server's style. The default dialog includes:

- A welcoming message
- Server information
- Links to rules or guides
- Quick action buttons

You can find the default welcome dialog at:

```
plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs/welcome.json
```

Feel free to edit this file directly to customize the welcome message, colors, buttons, and content.

## Customizing the Welcome Dialog

Here's an example of a customized welcome dialog:

```json
{
  "id": "welcome",
  "title": "<gradient:#ff7300:#ffaa00>Welcome to Our Server!</gradient>",
  "canCloseWithEscape": false,
  "body": [
    { "text": "<color:#ffaa00>Hello <color:#ff7300>%player_name%</color>!</color>" },
    { "text": "" },
    { "text": "Welcome to our amazing Minecraft server!" },
    { "text": "We're excited to have you here." },
    { "text": "" },
    { "text": "<color:#aaaaaa>Before you start, please review our rules.</color>" }
  ],
  "buttons": [
    {
      "label": "View Rules",
      "tooltip": "Read the server rules",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "open_dialog",
          "data": "server_rules"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "label": "Get Started",
      "tooltip": "Close this dialog and start playing",
      "actions": [
        {
          "name": "message",
          "data": "<color:#00ff00>Have fun playing!</color>"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Configuration Options

### Changing the Welcome Dialog

If you've created a custom dialog and want to use it as your welcome dialog, update the `plugins/FancyDialogs/config.yml` file:

```yaml
welcome_dialog_id: "my_custom_welcome"
```

Make sure your custom dialog file exists in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs/` folder with the matching ID.

### Disabling the Welcome Dialog

If you don't want to show a welcome dialog on your server, you can disable this feature in `plugins/FancyDialogs/featureFlags.yml`:

```yaml
disable-welcome-dialog: true
```

After changing this setting, restart your server or use `/fancydialogs reload` to apply the changes.

## Example: Multi-Step Welcome Flow

You can create a multi-step welcome experience by chaining dialogs together:

```json
{
  "id": "welcome",
  "title": "Welcome - Step 1",
  "body": [
    { "text": "Welcome! Let's get you started." }
  ],
  "buttons": [
    {
      "label": "Next",
      "actions": [
        { "name": "open_dialog", "data": "welcome_rules" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This creates an interactive onboarding experience where players progress through multiple dialogs.

    The welcome dialog is only shown to players on their first join. If you want to test changes, you can manually open it with `/dialog open <player> welcome`
