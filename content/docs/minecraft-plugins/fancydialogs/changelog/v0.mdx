Initial **alpha version** of FancyDialogs.

You can already create dialogs in the `plugins/FancyDialogs/data/dialogs` directory.

Open dialogs with the `/dialog` command.

You can add the `open_dialog` action to npcs by FancyNpcs to open certain dialogs when interacting with npcs.

Work-in-progress:
- Quick actions hotkey
- Tutorial system
- Input controls
- Button action system

I hope you enjoy creating wonderful dialogs already!
